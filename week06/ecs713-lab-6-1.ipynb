    "**Problems with Jupyter** There are problems with using Jupyter notebooks in connection with IO. The basic issue is that standard Haskell IO functions are fairly simple-minded, and the framework you are likely to be using to run the notebooks is not. If you are doing what I am, then you are running the server on a Docker container. This means in particular that it has an encapsulated filesystem. So the starting point is that Haskell expects interactions to be taking place in the container. This is a particular issue for inputs. The notebook will look for files in the container's filesystem, not the one on your computer. This is not so bad, you can always upload things. But it is a real issue for keyboard input. It will try to take input from a handle called \"stdin\". This is not connected to your keyboard, so it will appear empty. Here is a simple experiment, run the cell below: "
